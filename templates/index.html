            Welcome to the Florida Club Rowing workout tracker, featuring data for twelve rowers (six men and six women) from the University of Floridaâ€™s competitive club rowing team.

            This tracker covers workouts recorded from January 13, 2025, to March 13, 2025. It captures the beginning of the spring training season and ends before spring break training because training increases to twice a day and attendance rates decrease, which skews the data.

             During the spring semester, rowers train for a 2,000 meter race. It's like running a 5k, split in half and much harder than you could ever imagine. The men and women's team practice six days a week for two hours. There are four teams: men's varsity, men's novice, women's varisty and women's novice. There are five races throughout the semester. From Florida to Tennessee, Florida Club Rowing travels to various locations to compete against other division or club teams.

            Florida Club Rowing is a student-run organization under the University of Florida's Department of Recreational Sports and was founded in 1984. The club competes against Division I, II, III, and other club teams in one of the most physically demanding sports.
